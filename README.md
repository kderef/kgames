# KGames

Spritual successor to [Multisim](https://github.com/kderef/multisim).
---
The goal is to create a scripting engine for making your own games,  
this is to be achieved by exposing a few [macroquad](https://macroquad.rs) functions through [Rhai script](https://rhai.rs),  
and allowing the user to look through the detected scritps in a graphical menu.
